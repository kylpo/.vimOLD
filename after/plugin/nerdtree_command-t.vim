" NERDTree and Command-T compatibility hack
"
" Open an empty buffer and then start a real NERDTree, but only if
" vim was opened with a single directory as the first argument.
" The empty buffer gives command-t a buffer in which to open a
" file, rather than having it fail to clobber the default directory browser.
"
" This preserves the NERDTree netrw browsing replacement, but overrides it
" when vim is first loading.
"
" This script is in after/plugins since it needs to add the autocmd
" override after the plugin's autocmds are loaded and defined.
